Results:
Based on the provided RMSE values:

Persistence Model (Baseline): RMSE: 0.14974302386170033

AR Model: RMSE: 0.13536621894651454

MA Model: RMSE: 0.14390526400259437

ARIMA Model: RMSE: 0.1350972955338333

ARMA Model: RMSE: 0.1508977627286995

SARIMA Model: RMSE: 0.1412855414531333

The Persistence model serves as a baseline, and all time series models (AR, MA, ARIMA, ARMA, SARIMA) outperform it in terms of RMSE.

Among the individual models:

ARIMA performs the best with the lowest RMSE.
AR and SARIMA perform similarly, with AR having a slightly lower RMSE than SARIMA.
MA has a slightly higher RMSE compared to AR but is still better than the Persistence model.
ARMA has a higher RMSE compared to other models.
Overall Recommendation:
After model testing, it is evident that ARIMA stands out as the most effective model for our dataset with the lowest RMSE. This suggests that ARIMA is particularly well-suited for our specific data characteristics and forecasting needs.
